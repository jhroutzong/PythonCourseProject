This is a Database Python GUI project that implements hierarchy functionality for a Sports Manager(Leagues, 
Teams, and Members) with options to save and load files locally as well as emailing members.
You must have Qt Designer installed for this program to work on your machine. You will need to run leagueWindow1
as your main window.
